After about 20s of staring wondering if this was what was actually going on, the older lady jolted her hand having felt hers in her bag and I immediately stepped in. Victim is fine, bit shook but remarkably calm. Nothing taken in the end. Scumbag ran away with her dropoff accomplice as soon as the Luas doors opened at the next stop. Apparently she is ok making a call to the guards later on by herself but I doubt anything will happen. Props the Luas driver for halting and checking if she was ok.\n",

      "Text = Ireland has long been known for its friendly and welcoming people. As someone who has been living in the country for over 20 years, I can attest to the warmth and inclusivity of Irish society. However, recent reports and incidents suggest that racism is becoming more frequent in this country, and it's time we take notice of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until recently, I have been fortunate enough not to experience racism firsthand or witness it happening to those close to me. But, unfortunately, this changed on the eve of Saint Patrick's Day this year when two visitors from Spain, the children of a dear friend, were subjected to verbal abuse and mockery while traveling on the LUAS green line. \n",
      "\n",
      "The incident took place in the tram  where my visitors, a girl aged 17 and her older brother aged 19, were sitting down on their way to the city centre. In around Sandyford, three teenage girls with way too much make up, orange tan and fake implements, sat down beside them and upon hearing them speaking between themselves in their native Spanish they proceeded to mock and verbally abuse them for the duration of the trip all the way to Saint Stephen’s Green where my guests and the rude teens were due to disembark. My guests, behaved exemplary by not engaging with them and decided to wait for an additional stop to avoid further abuse. \n",
      "\n",
      "To say that they were shocked and disappointed is an understatement, and I, as a host feel enraged and disgusted because I know their behaviour is not representative of this great little country. But perhaps what disappointed them, and me, the most, is the fact that nobody, not a single person, in the packed Luas intervened and stepped in to defend visitors to this country from such a blatant attack of racism and abuse. We all feel let down and of all the amazing things they’ve seen and done during their short visit, that incident will undoubtedly stick in their minds when they think of Ireland. \n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the incident in particular, it highlights once more the problem we have in this country with unruly, and I dare to say borderline delinquent, behaviour of gangs of teenage boys and girls. I admit that part of me understands why nobody stepped in. They’re afraid because they know that, if engaged or told off, those teenagers will only escalate and regardless of what they do or say they will get away with it. What are you going to do? Tell the Gardai? Is more hassle than it’s worth it. Tell Luas security? It would be too late by the time it helps in any way. \n",
      "\n",
      "During the last bit of snow I had a teenage boy threw a ball of ice/snow to the windscreen of my car while travelling approximately at 40 km/h nearby a LUAS stop with my daughter in the passenger seat. An innocent enough incident, but I decided to stop the car and confront him to point out that it was dangerous as I could have swerved the car by pure reflexes and hit somebody. This emboldened him even more, but again, people who had witnessed the incident and were passing by after getting off the tram simply stared with blank faces afraid to being drawn into the altercation instead of backing me up. \n",
      "\n",
      "All I ask is that people win back the dignity of this country from these teenage thugs by sticking together and not acting like merely spectators when they witness acts of injustice or delinquent behaviour under the very noses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also the government, and I don’t care if it’s FF or FG or Sinn Féin or anybody else, the Department of Justice, and the Gardai must do more to enable its citizens to fight back this plague without being afraid and ensure that this behaviour doesn’t go unpunished. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s prove that Ireland is indeed the land of the hundred thousands welcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "PS: Note that I was not on the Luas with them at the time of the incident but they explained to me what had happened afterwards and showed me some video they captured in case things took a turn for the worst (which I will absolutely not share here).\n"

Get to the checkout in SuperValu and while surrounded by folks queuing, my body decides right then there is the best time to have a random coughing fit. Like the type of coughing fit a 40 a day smoker has, uncontrollable and never ending. I’ve  a fair idea of what caused it (most likely built up mucus from said flu) but why it randomly decided to do it then and there...I’m still convinced my body just likes to fuck with me at times.

It's to stop people accidently tagging on and tagging off immediately afterwards by holding their card up to the machine for too long, or trying to 'make sure' that they are tagged on by repeatedly tagging the machine. I don't know what the downtime is, but for sure it is at least a few minutes, which is more than enough to miss a Luas.\n",

      "In an attempt to resolve the dispute, Kevin Foley of the Labour Court recommended that Transdev carry out a risk assessment to determine that cooler bags “are capable of transporting drivers’ packed lunches safely from one depot to another”.

      "“If the company could prove a cooler bag could resolve the issue it would have done so before now. I don’t believe that the cooler bags are practical,” he said, adding that take up of the offer of cooler bags by drivers had been poor.\n",

      "\n",
      ">The Night-time Economy\n",
      "Countries around the world are experiencing the benefits of a healthy night-time economy. The commonly recognised timeframe of activity in this sector is 6pm – 6am. This involves music venues, bars, restaurants, spectator sporting events, cinemas, theatres, shops, transport companies, and various other forms of hospitality. Our nearest neighbour, the UK, values its night-time economy at £66 billion per year. It is impossible however, to measure the night-time economy’s worth in Ireland, given the heavy restrictions placed on night-time businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      ">To achieve growth in the night-time industry, a complete rethink of our licensing laws and structure around them needs to take place.\n",
      "\n",
      ">There is a lack of clarity running through the licensing system in Ireland, with regulations that can vastly differ from county to county. Unlike our European counterparts, Ireland lacks a specific set of decision-makers in relation to night-time events and licensing, with limited initiatives in place to enhance the night-time economy.\n",
      "\n",
      ">As a starting point, Give Us The Night (GUTN) believe that a night-time commission/advisory group should be established in each major city as soon as possible. These groups can provide expert knowledge as well as recommendations on the local night-time economy, based on a range of research and consumer feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Night Mayor / Licensing. GUTN welcome the establishment of a Night Mayor (Maor Oíche) in each major city. A Night Mayor (or equivalent individual such as ‘Night Czar’ or ‘Night-Time Economy Advisor’) has been established in cities across the world including London, Manchester, Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris and New York to great effect.\n",
      "\n",
      ">A Night Mayor can act as a liaison between stakeholders in the night-time industry. The Night Mayor would work alongside the Lord Mayor of that city, the city council, An Garda Síochána, venue operators, and event programmers.\n",
      "\n",
      ">GUTN also believe that the formation of licensing boards within city and county councils would aid the work of the Night Mayor, or alternatively work as stand-alone groups in areas where no Night Mayor exists. Councils could establish these groups to provide more time, fairness and transparency to licensing application decisions. This would also devolve more power to local authorities, to make decisions related to their own specific night-time economy.\n",
      "\n",
      ">There could also be a fresh approach to granting occasional licences for one-off music and cultural events of all sizes. With a growing festival market, we feel that some of these events could provide an opportunity to test extended opening hours in suitable areas on a pilot scheme basis.\n",
      "\n",
      ">In 2005, when the UK modernised their licensing system, it was the Department of Culture, Media and Sport that spearheaded the change. More power and responsibility could be designated to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in Ireland, who can influence positive change and growth for the night-time industry.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Abolition of Special Exemption Orders. The Special Exemption Order (SEO) system for late bars and nightclubs has failed, with a current drop in exchequer revenue of roughly €5 million per annum since its price increase in 2008. This increase, from €220 to €410 per night, has also led to widespread venue closures and job losses in the last decade. 90,691 SEOs were granted nationally in 2007, while the state estimates that 37,500 were granted in 2017. \n",
      "\n",
      ">Venues availing of annual dance licences also decreased, from 1,635 nationwide (2007) to 930 nationwide (2013). Annual dance licence figures beyond 2013 have not been published, but the current figure is thought to have dropped considerably since 2013. \n",
      "\n",
      ">A late-night venue in Ireland that would choose to open 6 days a week would pay approximately €128,000 per year (plus legal fees for each monthly court application) on SEOs. This is in addition to rates, rent, insurance, running costs, wages etc. A venue in the UK will pay around £2,000 per year in late licence fees, with more hours of trading each night possible. Through the combination of restricted opening hours and the large financial outlay required for SEOs, operators have struggled to modernise their venues and to improve production standards, which has impacted on the experience for patrons. \n",
      "We propose that the SEO system is scrapped entirely. It is an outdated system (operated only in Ireland) that stifles growth in the industry, wastes court time and makes no distinction between late bars and music venues. We suggest that late bars and music venues apply for separate specific annual licences, in place of monthly SEOs. An affordable annual licence fee based on floor space and overall turnover could replace SEO fees. This would encourage music venues to open more nights per week, which will create more jobs in the industry. To incentivise new venues opening, we also propose that start-up businesses be exempt from the first year of their annual licence fee. \n",
      "\n",
      ">GUTN believe it is time to clearly identify the differences between public bars and purpose-built music venues, and to legislate accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      ">To achieve this, we recommend the introduction of a designated ‘night venue’ classification in planning and licensing law in Ireland. This classification should cover fire, safety, operating times, egress, impact on locality and cultural value to the city.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Criteria for a successful application as a night venue could include:\n",
      "– Suitability of location\n",
      "– Quality of programming\n",
      "– Facilities for performance\n",
      "– Sufficient ratio of dancing area to standing area\n",
      "– Sound system specifications\n",
      "– Soundproofing (where necessary)\n",
      "– Patron safety strategy\n",
      "– Commitment to staff excellence (employer to provide ongoing upskill training)\n",
      "– Preparation of a Venue Management Plan in agreement with local Gardaí, fire officer and council\n",
      "\n",
      ">A night venue licence would be applied for on an annual basis.\n",
      "\n",
      ">In conjunction with the introduction of a ‘night venue’ classification, we feel sequential closing across the night-time industry should be introduced to allow all stakeholders such as public bars, restaurants, late bars, and night venues to work in tandem.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Closing at graduated times would encourage a safe and pleasant experience for all, putting less strain on Gardaí, emergency services and late night transport services.\n",
      "\n",
      ">This system would enable many night-time businesses to operate according to their own specific customer demand, reaching a full potential of earnings in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Much like the European model for creative spaces, we envisage that some night venues could be also used as multi-purpose spaces for daytime activities and events. These creative and cultural spaces can support emerging artists and projects, providing employment and training across a range of artistic disciplines. To develop and promote the creative arts in Ireland, we believe that the state should make more of these spaces available. GUTN advocate a standard closing time of up to 6am for night venues. Pending approval, this closing time would be at the discretion of night venue operators. Venues should also have the opportunity to apply for additional operating hours if further conditions and local approval are met.\n",
